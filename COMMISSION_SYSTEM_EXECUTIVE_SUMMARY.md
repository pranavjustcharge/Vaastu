## ðŸ“ˆ Commission Calculation Example

### Scenario: 10% Commission on â‚¹10,000 Booking

```
Step 1: Admin sets commission to 10% PERCENTAGE
Step 2: Customer books service for â‚¹10,000 via BA referral
Step 3: System calculates:
  - Base Commission = 10,000 Ã— (10 / 100) = â‚¹1,000
  - GST = 1,000 Ã— (18 / 100) = â‚¹180
  - Total Commission = â‚¹1,180
Step 4: Transaction recorded in database
Step 5: BA's earnings updated:
  - totalEarnings += â‚¹1,180
  - pendingEarnings += â‚¹1,180
Step 6: BA sees â‚¹1,180 in dashboard
```

## ðŸ”„ Complete Workflow

```
1. ADMIN CONFIGURES
   â””â”€ Sets commission type & value
   â””â”€ Configures GST
   â””â”€ Saves to database

2. BA VIEWS COMMISSION
   â””â”€ Fetches commission info from API
   â””â”€ Sees "10% of booking value"
   â””â”€ Understands earning structure

3. CUSTOMER BOOKS
   â””â”€ Uses BA's referral link
   â””â”€ Books service for â‚¹10,000
   â””â”€ Booking created with referralCode

4. COMMISSION CALCULATED
   â””â”€ System calculates: â‚¹1,000 base + â‚¹180 GST = â‚¹1,180
   â””â”€ Transaction recorded
   â””â”€ BA earnings updated

5. BA SEES EARNINGS
   â””â”€ Dashboard shows Total Earnings: â‚¹1,180
   â””â”€ Shows Approved Earnings: â‚¹0 (pending approval)
   â””â”€ Can request withdrawal
