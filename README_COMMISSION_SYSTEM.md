## 💻 Commission Calculation

### Formula

```
IF commissionType = PERCENTAGE:
  baseCommission = transactionAmount × (commissionValue / 100)
ELSE:
  baseCommission = commissionValue

IF excludeGSTFromBase = true:
  gst = baseCommission × (gstPercentage / 100)
  totalCommission = baseCommission + gst
ELSE:
  gst = 0
  totalCommission = baseCommission
```

### Example: 10% PERCENTAGE Commission

```
Booking Amount: ₹10,000
Commission Type: PERCENTAGE
Commission Value: 10%
GST Percentage: 18%
Exclude GST from Base: true

Calculation:
  Base Commission = 10,000 × (10 / 100) = ₹1,000
  GST = 1,000 × (18 / 100) = ₹180
  Total Commission = ₹1,180

Result: BA earns ₹1,180
```
